This is the directory for all parallel c
hashtables.

There is no builtin parallel hashtable in c

alt_hashtable:
The only hashtable current in the directory is alt_hashtable which is
the parallelized version of alt_hashtable from sequential. More to
come. It shares all the same features with the sequential
alt_hashtable. The locking is done via the lower bits in the next ptr
of the first node in each slot. This means that 62 is the maximum
number of threads. You can increase this by either increasing the
allignment (i.e instead of 64, make it 128 and 126 concurrent readers
will be possible). The other alternative is to replace lowbit locking
with highbit locking. This would affect the resizing optimization. A
version that allows for high bit locking will be added
eventually. Like the sequential version difference configurations are
managed by #defines set in test_config.h. test.py is also present to
assist in easy testing.
