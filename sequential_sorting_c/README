This is the directory for all sequential c sorting algorithms. lookin
builtin_sort/ for an example of how to write a driver to add a new
sort. For all helper functions related to actually using the sort,
please place in driver.h (against built_sort/driver.h has an example
of that for qsort). If you want to modify a sort thats in here let me
know/make a new project (suggested to just copy builtin_sort and
you'll basically be done writing the driver).

Correctness standard:
result matches result of math.h::qsort on copy of the array to be
sorted. Do not add anything that does not meat this standard.

Memory leaks:
None unless it crashes (i.e failed alloc)

Right now:

prep_sort:
very good for sorting strings/long byte arrays, decent for integers
(better than quicksort on larger arrays but in not inplace)

normal_sort:
This is just a library I like. Its really optimized but it only sorts
char/short/int/long and it tough to configure/make useful

builtin_sort
This is the template/uses math.h qsort.
