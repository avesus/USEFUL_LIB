This is the directory for all sequential cpp
hashtables. builtin_hashtable is C++ standard unordered_map.

This uses test_config.h to determine the hashtable type. test.py will
write over the config file to allow easy testing.

flat_hashtable:
This is a phenominal hashtable. The only issue with it is that right
now it cant take char* (only string) which makes inserting text based
keys/values unnecissarily slow. (for that alt_hashtable in the c
hashtable dir is faster). Aside from that this is the best for
speed. It has fairly high space usage but its throughput is top notch.

builtin_hashtable:
standard cpp unordered map.
